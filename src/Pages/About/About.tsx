                            Hey there again! üëã My journey has been all about
                            embracing change and following my passions.
                            Originally, I was on track for a career in law‚Äîgot
                            admitted to law schools and all. But as I delved
                            deeper into legal world, I realized my heart wasn't
                            in it. Instead, I found myself drawn to the exciting
                            world of technology. The endless possibilities
                            fascinated me, so I made a big decision to switch
                            gears. üí° That's when I jumped into software
                            engineering and enrolled in a software engineering
                            bootcamp, where I immersed myself in learning the
                            ins and outs of software development. Now? Well,{" "}
                            {learnMore ? (
                                `Fast forward to today, I proudly stand as a
                            proficient full-stack web developer. With a solid
                            foundation in front-end and back-end development, I
                            thrive in crafting intuitive, robust, and
                            user-centric web solutions that make an impact. üöÄ
                            My journey's taught me a lot about adaptability,
                            resilience, and the importance of pursuing what
                            truly lights you up inside. I'm always up for
                            learning something new, innovating, and using tech
